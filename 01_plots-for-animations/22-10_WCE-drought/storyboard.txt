To understand the potential role of climate change in the European drought of 2022, we looked at the average soil moisture content each summer in a large region of western Central Europe.
2
The hotter the event (further up), the rarer it becomes (further right). 
3
The 2022 drought is plotted here.  
4
The other black dots represent the soil moisture content each summer, going back to 1950.
 5
The 2022 event is a ‘1 in 13-year event,’ meaning it has about an 8% chance of happening each year.
 6
Statistical modelling is used to estimate the intensity of similar events happening in the 2022 climate (red dots) and in a 1.2°C cooler world, without human-caused climate change (blue dots). 
 7
Nowadays, events like the 2022 drought are now about 8% drier and about 15 times more likely because of human-caused climate change.
